## Issues & solutions
* <Router /> tag can only be use once in the App, otherwise the links and routes don't render components correctly
- in tests with enzyme and jest:
* <BrowserRouter> tag needs to wrap the component in wrapper to avoid the error 'Link needs to be in Router'
* inconsistency in tests working and not find.lenght etc - > *TO FIX*
* BUG -> when you create a new user and go straight into creating habits and create a habit and press 'ADD' -> it redirects you to Tracker but doesn't map the array of habit for some reason. After you go through the 'login' route it does -> *TO FIX*
* passing a parameter AND event in handleChange: solved:

defining the function:
```
handleChange = (event, habitIndex) => {}
```
in input:
```
onChange={event => this.handleChange(event, index)}
```
* A component is changing an uncontrolled input of type number to be controlled.
* a 1 character / change delay in handleChange function --> hence we want to introduce React Hooks
